For a while now, I have been working on a project called FDGL (Factorio Distributed Griefer List).
The main point of the whole project is to have a central database of violations of rules
(we call violations "reports" and rules "categories"), so that any record can be found by everyone.
Recently, I began on a rework of the project so that it works better and I decided to go with
Cloudflare Workers as my hosting of choice. Since multiple services use the same exact backend,
I decided to utilize the new [RPC support](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/rpc/)
that Workers have been given. I have encountered some issues when building this, so I decided that I will
share my experience with Workers RPC.

After getting the initial setup right - it took me ages, which is however my fault for not reading the docs
correctly - I was able to communicate between my two workers. Great! Now I needed to migrate my whole backend
into its separate worker so that it could be exposed with a backend, and accessed by a Discord bot. I naively
thought that any implementation would work. Previously, I wrote multiple API wrappers for clients. Every "base route"
(such as "/users") would be its own class with methods for various endpoints, so you could access
say a "/users/:id" on `api.users.fetchById(id)`. This setup is not too difficult to implement. I decided to
do essentially the same, but I would replace calls to an API with calls to the database and some backend logic.
Additionally, I needed to add some getters to be able to access this over the RPC boundary.

```ts
class Users {
	constructor(private db: Kysely<DB>) {}
	async fetchById(id: string): Promise<User | null> {
		return await this.db
			.selectFrom("users")
			.selectAll()
			.where("id", "=", id)
			.executeTakeFirst()
	}
}

class API {
	#users: Users
	constructor(private db: Kysely<DB>) {
		this.#users = new Users(db)
	}
	get users() {
		return this.#users
	}
}
```

Amazing! Now, to get it set up in a Worker instance, test `API.users.fetchById`, and...

I get an error. `The RPC receiver does not implement the method "categories".` What?
That makes no sense. `categories` is a property that I can access through a getter.
That should definitely work. Well, let's replace the call with a `users__getUserById`
and implement that on the RPC worker. Huh. That works. What's up?

As it turns out, reading the announcements *does* in fact help. It might not be in the docs,
but the announcement post directly states "you can pass [Structured Clonable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm#supported_types)
types as the params or return value of an RPC". Those types are the basic types,
such as Array, Boolean, Map, Number, String, and most importantly, Object - but
only "plain" objects. The announcement post also states that I can pass functions
in and out, or objects with methods - this is important for later. Searching
MDN and the internet tells me that a plain object is basically just `{}`.
The issue is that a class instance is *not* a simple
`{}` creation, so what does that mean for me and my backend?

Turns out, I can utilize some interesting features of JavaScript and TypeScript in order to
achieve my goal, `Function.prototype.bind()` being the main star here. You can call `.bind()`
on any function, and as a first parameter, you provide it it's `this` variable. Any time the
bound function is called, instead of referencing itself, it can reference the object provided
as its `this`. See the modified example from MDN below.

```js
const module = {
  x: 42,
  getX: function () {
    return this.x;
  },
};

const boundGetX = module.getX.bind(module);
const unboundGetX = module.getX
console.log(unboundGetX(), boundGetX()) // undefined, 42
module.x = 44
console.log(unboundGetX(), boundGetX()) // undefined, 44
```

I can utilize it pretty nicely. Remember how we can pass objects with methods
through Workers RPC? Well, `bind` allows us to create a *new function* which calls
the original with the new parameters. This means that essentially, we aren't
calling `module.getX`, but a function that through inner JS workings calls
`module.getX` eventually and returns our desired answer. A similar process
can be applied to classes, but you wouldn't usually do this - the
bound function does the same thing as the unbound one, only with some inner JS
quirks in between. However, these inner JS quirks are what we are after here -
we get a new function that returns our result, but importantly, we don't need to
pass the `Users` object over RPC - instead, we can "recreate" it using `.bind()` calls.

```ts
class Users {
	constructor(private db: Kysely<DB>) {}
	async fetchById(id: string): Promise<User | null> {
		return await this.db
			.selectFrom("users")
			.selectAll()
			.where("id", "=", id)
			.executeTakeFirst()
	}
}

class API {
	#users: Users
	constructor(private db: Kysely<DB>) {
		this.#users = new Users(db)
	}
	get users() {
		return {
			fetchById: this.#users.fetchById.bind(this.#users)
		}
	}
}
```

In the example above, a call on `API.users.fetchById` would be proxied, and thus
a direct object is not passed - that means we pass all criteria for Workers RPC
to be able to send our methods over successfuly! With a dash of type magic, we can
improve our getter to error if we don't have some methods from the `Users` class
implemented, and now we have backend working again - just over RPC.

```ts
type PickMatching<T, V> = {
	[K in keyof T as T[K] extends V ? K : never]: T[K];
};
// biome-ignore lint/complexity/noBannedTypes: it's okay here as it is only a picker
type ExtractMethods<T> = PickMatching<T, Function>;

class API {
	// ...
	get users() {
		return {
			fetchById: this.#users.fetchById.bind(this.#users)
		} satisfies ExtractMethods<Users>
	}
}
```

There are a couple more interesting things that I'll be solving with Workers in
the very close future, such as synchronization of state with distributed clients
that I do not directly control, but those will need to wait until I actually have
any idea on how to solve them (properly).
